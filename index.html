	<p>Answer to question 8<br>Algorithm for finding the winning id in a lottery:<br>

Input: n (the number of lottery tickets)<br>

Create a list of ids from 1 to n<br>
While the length of the list is greater than 1, repeat steps 3-5<br>
Remove every alternate id starting from the first id<br>
If the length of the list is 1, break out of the loop and return the remaining id as the winner<br>
Remove every alternate id starting from the last id<br>
If the length of the list is 1, break out of the loop and return the remaining id as the winner<br>
Repeat steps 3-6 until only one id remains<br>
Return the winning id.<br></p>
